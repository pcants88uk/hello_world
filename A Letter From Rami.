Hello Mr. C!
I've reached out to you because I couldn't find you anywhere on the internet
Also I really appreciate how you encouraged me to continue learning Coding and Computering
Now I have learned JavaScript, Python and pHp.
And I've been thinking about taking Computer Science for my IGCSE and A-Level
I would love to speak to you through your email :)
Feel free to email me at ramirasheed@aaess.sch.ae

Thank You So Much,
Rami.
